# Contact Manager

<p>
    You are working on a Contact Manager app. You have created the contact object </br>
   constructor which has two arguments, name and number.
    You need to add a print() method to the object which will output the contact data to the console in the following format: <br>
    <b>
    name: number
    </b>
    <br>
    The given code declares two objects and calls their <b>print()</b> methods. Complete the code by defining the <b>print()</b> method for the objects.
