# The Snail in the Well

<p>
    The snail climbs up 7 feet each day and slips back 2 feet each night. </br>
    How many days will it take the snail to get out of a well with the given depth?
</p>

### <b>Sample Input:</b>
<p>31</p>

### <b>Sample Output:</b>
<p>6/p>

### <b>Explanation:</b>
Let't break down the distance the snail covers each day.
<p>Day 1: 7 -2 = 5</p>
<p>Day 2: 5 + 7 -2 = 10</p>
<p>Day 3: 10 + 7 -2 = 15</p>
<p>Day 4: 15+ 7 -2 = 20</p>
<p>Day 5: 20 + 7 -2 = 25</p>
<p>Day 6: 25 + 7 = 32</p>

### so, on Day 6 the snail will each 232 feet and get out of the well at day, without slipping back that night.
